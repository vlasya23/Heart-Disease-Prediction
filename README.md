# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict heart disease in patients using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions based on the best performing model. The dataset used for this project is the reprocessed.hungarian.data from the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, and others.

## Description

The notebook trains several machine learning models to predict heart disease using a dataset containing various health parameters. The models evaluated include:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Naive Bayes

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is preprocessed and scaled to improve the accuracy of the models.The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

You can downnload the Dataset here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease, it includes the reprocessed.hungarian.data file.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
You can install these dependencies using pip: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn notebook

## Results

The project demonstrates the following:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and scaling features.
Training multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
Evaluating the performance of these models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
